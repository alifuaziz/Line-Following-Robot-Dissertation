\section{Discussion and Further Work}

Because of the structure of the code (the object oriented structure to the code), it will be easier to modify and reuse to code to add features that are required in the further development of the honeycomb maze. 
When there is sufficient evidence that further types of investigation setups are required (such as platforms which move), these features can easily be added to the program. This is because it has been written in a modular and readable was according to the 'SOLID' framework for writing object oriented programs.

\\
Examples of further features that could be added are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Better integration with DLC (probably)
    \item More support for the target platform moving around 
    \item More robust 'first step' of the path finding algorithm as an exhaustive search of the different combinations are the only reason I know that there won't be a problem for the number of robots that there are on the 
\end{enumerate}
