\section*{Acknowledgements}

I am grateful to Prof. John O'Keefe for the opportunity to under take the project and would like to extend my gratitude to Dr Jake Ormond for supervising me on this project and providing constructive feedback on my work.

Further to this I would like to thank Dr Steven West on guidance for understanding the paradigm of object oriented programming as well as providing the space to discuss implementation details.

I would also like to extend my thanks to everyone 
in the O'Keefe Laboratory for being so generous with their time, resources as well as providing the environment for me to develop my critical thinking skills and academic intuition.
